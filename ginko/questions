1. Business logic in Controller Class, example: OrderDishesController has Bl. 
Is this Ok or schould I insert another Layer Business logic as central class for BL? 

2. Is it necessary to introduce interfaces for loose coupling UI to BL and BL to DAO? 

- Form rating - single forms for every dish? How can we aggregate all ratings for 
an order in a single form and pass different dishid/rating tuples?


3. How can I test a controller?
